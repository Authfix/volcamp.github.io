Development addict, I manipulated various front-end, back-end and cloud technologies. Attached to maintaining a culture of continuous improvement of the code quality and the well being of the team, I find myself in the values ​​conveyed by philosophies such as those of Devops, Clean Code or Software Craftmanship.
